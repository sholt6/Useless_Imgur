# Useless Imgur

A Python script which scrapes the top 5 posts from Imgur and posts them to the Twitter account, @useless_imgur

Created purely for educational purposes.

Will only post once per day. Ignores gifs and albums with multiple images. No responsibility accepted for content!

This repo has few commits. This is because the original version contained the Twitter access keys as barewords in the code. Therefore, when I came to upload to GitHub, I started a new repo with the latest version of the code, for which the access keys are in a local config file and not accessible.
